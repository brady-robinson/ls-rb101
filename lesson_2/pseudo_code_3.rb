# define a method that takes one argument, an array of integers
# iterate through the array so that only the odd indexes
# are taken and added to another array

# START

# Given an array of integers called array

# SET return_array = []
# iterate over array
# IF array index is odd
    # add to return_array
# ELSE
    # NEXT iteration

# PRINT return_array
